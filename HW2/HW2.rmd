title: "HW1 - Name here"
output: 
  html_document:
    css: "styles.css"

```{r}
# This is an R code block, you can write R code and it will be executed.
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

data[5:1]
```


In order to get a usable output you will need to run the command below:
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('hw2.rmd')"

Or in the R console:
rmarkdown::render('hw1.rmd')

This will yield a file called hw1.html, which can be viewed in a web browser

You will also need the following packages installed:
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr", "pandoc"))

By default, I have included a styles.css file, which makes the output prettier. You may edit that file with minimal css knowledge.

Formatting outside of code blocks is done using markdown syntax.

# Header 1
## Header 2
(header 1 is a large header, header 2 is a smaller header)
*italics*
**Bold**
~strikethrough~

\ = newline

ex. This is a line\
This is a new line
